+-----------+

Explanation: 
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select round(sum(player_login)/count(distinct player_id),2) as fraction
from 
(select player_id,
datediff(event_date,min(event_date) over(partition by player_id))=1 as player_login
from activity) as new_table;
