Explanation: The average experience years for the first project is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00 and for the second project is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select p.project_id, round(avg(e.experience_years),2) as average_years
from Project p
left join Employee e
on e.employee_id=p.employee_id
group by p.project_id;
